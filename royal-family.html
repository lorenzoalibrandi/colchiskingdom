    <h2 id="Member1">Daenerys Targaryen</h2>
    <p>
      Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Daenerys is one of the last surviving members (along with her older brother, Viserys) of House Targaryen which, until 14 years before the events of the first novel, had ruled Westeros from the Iron Throne
      for nearly 300 years before being ousted. She subsequently appeared in A Clash of Kings (1998) and A Storm of Swords (2000). Daenerys was one of a few prominent characters not included in 2005's A Feast for Crows, but returned in the next novel
      A Dance with Dragons (2011). In the story, Daenerys is in her early teens living in exile in Essos. She remains dependent on her abusive older brother, Viserys, and is forced to marry Dothraki horselord Khal Drogo in exchange for an army for
      Viserys, who wishes to return to Westeros and recapture the Iron Throne. Daenerys adapts to life with the Dothraki, and her character emerges as strong, confident and courageous. She becomes the heir of the Targaryen dynasty after her brother's
      murder and plans to reclaim the Iron Throne herself, seeing it as her birthright. A pregnant Daenerys loses her husband and child, but soon helps to hatch three dragons from their eggs. The dragons provide her with a tactical advantage and
      prestige. She also acquires an army with which she conquers the cities of Yunkai, Astapor and Meereen, determined to end slavery and injustice. Despite her strong moral compass, she can deal ruthlessly with her enemies, particularly slave
      masters. She establishes herself as a powerful and relentless ruler.

    <h2 id="Member2">Brienne of Tarth</h2>
    <p>
      Brienne is introduced in the second novel of the series, 1998's A Clash of Kings, as a warrior fighting for the honor of serving in the Kingsguard of Renly Baratheon. She later swears her loyalty to Catelyn Stark and vows to return the captive
      Jaime Lannister to King's Landing in exchange for Sansa and Arya Stark, whom Catelyn believes are being held by the Lannisters. She additionally appears in A Feast for Crows (2005) and A Dance with Dragons (2011). Because she is a woman,
      Brienne is barred from serving as a knight, even though she is one of the most honorable and skilled warriors in all of Westeros. Her personal struggle towards honor, justice, and recognition has received significant critical attention, as has
      her complex relationship with Jaime, and she is one of the most popular characters in both the novels and television show. In the television series, Brienne is portrayed by English actress Gwendoline Christie and is introduced in Season 2.
      After appearing as a recurring cast member for two seasons, Christie was promoted to the main cast from Season four onwards. Christie has received significant critical praise for her portrayal. For her performance in the Season 3, she was
      nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television and for two Screen Actors Guild Awards, alongside the rest of the cast, for the third and fourth seasons. In 2019, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for
      Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in the series's final season.

    <h2 id="Member3">Arya Stark</h2>
    <p>
      Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Arya is the third child and youngest daughter of Lord Ned Stark and his wife Lady Catelyn Stark. She is tomboyish, headstrong, feisty, independent, disdains traditional female pursuits, and is often
      mistaken for a boy. She wields a castle-forged steel smallsword named "Needle", a parting gift from her half-brother Jon Snow, and is trained in the Braavosi style of sword fighting by Syrio Forel. Arya is among the most popular characters in
      the series. Williams' performance has received critical acclaim. Williams was twice nominated for a Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016 and 2019. She and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen
      Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
